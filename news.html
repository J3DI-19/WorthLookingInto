        <h2>PRIME Study Progress Update — User Experience</h2>
        <p class="date">May 8, 2024</p>
        <p class="excerpt">People with quadriplegia often find that their needs to engage seamlessly with the digital world go unmet, leading to decreased independence, isolation, and financial challenges. Our goal is to provide a high-performance interface that will enhance the control of digital devices for people with quadriplegia, unlocking their personal and professional potential.</p>

        <h2>PRIME Study Progress Update</h2>
        <p class="date">April 12, 2024</p>
        <p class="excerpt">In January, we conducted the first human implantation of our brain-computer interface (BCI). We were able to detect the participant’s neural signals shortly after the implantation surgery, and since then, he has used our end-to-end BCI system for various applications, like playing online chess and Sid Meier's Civilization VI*. 

          This marks a significant milestone towards making BCI technology available to potentially restore autonomy to millions of people with unmet medical needs. We’ve prepared this blog post to share a high-level snapshot of where we are as a company: the mission that guides us, the technology we have built, the study we are currently conducting, and the work we have yet to do.
