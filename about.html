      <h2>About Neuralink</h2>
      <p>
        Neuralink Corporation, founded by Elon Musk in 2016, is a neurotechnology company focused on developing advanced brain-machine interface (BMI) technologies to enhance human capabilities and improve neurological health. The company aims to create high-bandwidth, implantable brain-computer interfaces that facilitate direct communication between the brain and external devices, aiming to treat neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injuries. Neuralink is working on developing thin, flexible brain implants and advanced robotic systems for surgical procedures. Their long-term vision includes achieving a symbiosis between artificial intelligence and the human brain, potentially revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.
